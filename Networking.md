# **Basic Networking Concepts for DevOps Engineer**

## **1. Introduction to Networking**
A **computer network** is a group of interconnected computers that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and applications. Each device in a network is assigned an **IP address**, which serves as its unique identifier.

### **Types of Networks**
1. **Personal Area Network (PAN)** ‚Äì Small network for personal use (e.g., Bluetooth).

## **3. IP Addressing and Subnetting**
An **IP address** is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network.

### **IPv4 Address Classes**
| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask | No. of Networks | No. of Hosts |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| A | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 | 128 | 16 million |
| B | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 | 16,384 | 65,536 |
| C | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 | 2 million | 256 |
| D | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | - | Multicast | - |
| E | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | - | Reserved | - |

### **Private vs Public IP Addresses**
- **Private IPs:** Used within a LAN (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x).
- **Public IPs:** Routable on the Internet, assigned by ISPs.

### **Subnetting**
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller networks.

- **Subnet Mask:** Defines network and host portions.
- **CIDR Notation:** `/8`, `/16`, `/24` indicate how many bits are for the network.
- Example:  
  - `192.168.1.0/24` (Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0) ‚Üí 256 total IPs, 254 usable.
  - `192.168.1.0/26` (Subnet mask: 255.255.255.192) ‚Üí 64 total IPs, 62 usable.

---

## **4. Network Devices**
### **Router**
- Connects different networks.
- Uses IP addresses to route data.
- Example: Home router connects your LAN to the Internet.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccf643f-642b-4feb-a593-d7e2e021f5b2)


### **Switch**
- Connects devices within a LAN.
- Uses MAC addresses to forward data efficiently.

## **5. Subnetting Practice**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25973873-65fd-442d-ab9b-3040b06a8e47)


### **Example 1:**
- Given: **192.168.1.0/26**
- Subnet Mask: **255.255.255.192**
- **Network ID:** `192.168.1.0`
- **Broadcast Address:** `192.168.1.63`
- **Usable IPs:** `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.62`
- **Total Hosts:** 64, **Usable Hosts:** 62

### **Example 2:**
- Given: **10.0.0.0/30**
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.252`
- **Usable IPs:** 2 (for point-to-point links)
- 


## **6. Types of Routing**

### **Types of Routing:**  

1. **Static Routing:**  
   - A technique where the network administrator manually adds routes to the routing table.  
   - It does not change automatically if the network topology changes.  
   - Suitable for small, stable networks with minimal route changes.  

2. **Default Routing:**  
   - A method where a router is configured to forward all packets to a predetermined next-hop device, regardless of the destination network.  
   - Commonly used when a router has only one exit path to an external network (e.g., connecting a local network to the internet).  

3. **Dynamic Routing:**  
   - A routing technique that uses dynamic protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP) to automatically discover and update routes.  
   - Adapts to network topology changes without manual intervention.  
   - Suitable for large and complex networks.  


### **What is a Protocol? **  

‚óè A system that allows two parties to communicate
‚óè A protocol is designed with a set of properties
‚óè Depending on the purpose of the protocol
‚óè TCP, UDP, HTTP, gRPC, FTP

## Protocol Properties

Here's a detailed breakdown of each networking concept with examples:

---

### **1. Data Format**
Defines how data is structured before transmission.

#### **a. Text-based Formats**
- **Plain Text**: Simple human-readable format.
  - Example: Sending an email using SMTP.
  
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Lightweight data-interchange format, widely used in APIs.
  - Example: REST API responses from a weather service (`{"temperature": 30, "unit": "Celsius"}`).

- **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**: Used for structured data exchange.
  - Example: SOAP web services (`<weather><temperature>30</temperature><unit>Celsius</unit></weather>`).

#### **b. Binary Formats**
- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**: Compact and efficient data serialization format developed by Google.
  - Example: gRPC communication between microservices.

- **RESP (Redis Serialization Protocol)**: Used by Redis for data exchange.
  - Example: Sending a Redis command: `SET key value`.

- **h2 (HTTP/2) & h3 (HTTP/3)**: Use binary framing for efficient web communication.
  - Example: Faster loading of web pages using HTTP/2 multiplexing.

---

### **2. Transfer Mode**
Defines how data is transferred over the network.

#### **a. Message-based Transfer**
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Lightweight, connectionless communication.
  - Example: Video streaming services like YouTube Live or VoIP (Skype, Zoom).

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Request-response protocol for web communication.
  - Example: A user requesting a webpage (`GET /index.html` from a browser).

#### **b. Stream-based Transfer**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, ordered, and error-checked streaming.
  - Example: A file download using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: Peer-to-peer streaming of audio/video.
  - Example: Google Meet video calls.

---

### **3. Addressing System**
Defines how devices are identified in the network.

- **DNS Name**: Human-readable domain names resolved to IP addresses.
  - Example: `www.google.com` ‚Üí `142.250.183.78`.

- **IP Address**: Unique identifier assigned to devices on a network.
  - Example: `192.168.1.1` for a router in a home network.

- **MAC Address**: Unique hardware address of a network device.
  - Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` for a laptop‚Äôs Wi-Fi adapter.

---

### **4. Directionality**
Defines how data flows in communication.

#### **a. Bidirectional Communication**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Allows full two-way communication.
  - Example: SSH remote login, where both client and server can send data.

#### **b. Unidirectional Communication**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: One-way request-response.
  - Example: A user submits a search query on Google, and Google returns results.

#### **c. Full-Duplex vs Half-Duplex**
- **Full Duplex**: Data can be sent and received simultaneously.
  - Example: A telephone call where both parties can talk at the same time.

- **Half Duplex**: Data can be sent in only one direction at a time.
  - Example: Walkie-talkies, where one person talks while the other listens.

Let me know if you need more details! üöÄ

### **7. What Does the Ping Command Do?**  

The **ping** command is a network utility used to test the connectivity between two network devices. It sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to a specified IP address or hostname and waits for a response. This helps determine:  
- Whether a device is reachable on the network.  
- The response time (latency) between the source and destination.  
- Packet loss, which indicates network issues.  

### **8. What is a NIC (Network Interface Card)?**  
A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is a hardware component that enables a computer to connect to a network. It can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).  

#### **Key Features of a NIC:**  
- Each NIC has a unique **MAC (Media Access Control) address**, which identifies the device on the network.  
- It allows communication between computers in a **Local Area Network (LAN)** or over the internet.  
- NICs are commonly used in **desktop computers, laptops, and servers** for network connectivity.  


Your definitions of **Public Address** and **Private Address** are mostly correct but could be refined for better clarity and readability. Here‚Äôs an improved version:  

---

### **9) Public Address**  
A **Public IP Address** (also known as an **external address**) is assigned by an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** and is used to communicate outside the local network. It allows devices to access the internet and be reached from remote locations.  

#### **Key Characteristics:**  
- **Global Scope** ‚Äì Public IP addresses are unique and can be accessed over the internet.  
- **Assigned by ISP** ‚Äì Internet providers allocate public IP addresses.  
- **Not Free** ‚Äì Public IPs are provided by ISPs at a cost.  
- **Enables Remote Access** ‚Äì It allows external users to connect to a device or server inside the network (e.g., hosting a home server).  

---

### **10) Private Address**  
A **Private IP Address** (also known as an **internal address**) is used within a **Local Area Network (LAN)** to communicate between devices. It cannot be accessed directly from the internet and helps maintain network security.  

#### **Key Characteristics:**  
- **Local Scope** ‚Äì Only used within a private network (e.g., home or office network).  
- **Used for LAN Communication** ‚Äì Enables communication between devices like computers, printers, and smartphones inside a network.  
- **Free of Cost** ‚Äì Private IPs do not require ISP allocation and are available for free.  
- **Not Routed on the Internet** ‚Äì Traffic from the internet cannot directly reach private IP addresses.  
- **Finding Private IP Address** ‚Äì Use the command `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) to view the private IP of your device.  

### **11) What is a Proxy Server?**  
**Ans:** A **proxy server** is an **intermediary** between a user's device and the internet. It forwards requests from clients to web servers and then returns the requested data to the client.  

### **Key Functions of a Proxy Server:**  
- **Hides the Client's IP Address** ‚Äì Enhances privacy and security.  
- **Filters Web Content** ‚Äì Blocks restricted websites and harmful content.  
- **Caches Data** ‚Äì Speeds up web browsing by storing frequently accessed resources.  
- **Improves Security** ‚Äì Acts as a firewall by preventing direct connections to potentially harmful sites.  
- **Provides Anonymity** ‚Äì Helps users stay anonymous by masking their real IP address.  


### **What is a Firewall?**  

A **firewall** is a **network security system** that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on **predefined security rules**. It acts as a **barrier** between a trusted internal network (e.g., a company‚Äôs private network) and an untrusted external network (e.g., the internet).  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf06065-e6d2-4834-9b4f-3995cece334a)


### **Functions of a Firewall:**  
‚úÖ **Monitors network traffic** ‚Äì Inspects data packets entering or leaving a network.  
‚úÖ **Blocks unauthorized access** ‚Äì Prevents hackers and malicious traffic from entering the system.  
‚úÖ **Implements security policies** ‚Äì Enforces rules to allow or deny specific types of traffic.  
‚úÖ **Prevents malware attacks** ‚Äì Detects and blocks suspicious activity.  
‚úÖ **Filters content** ‚Äì Restricts access to certain websites or applications.  

### **Types of Firewalls:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Packet Filtering Firewall (Layer 4)** ‚Äì Works at the network and transport layers, filtering packets based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Stateful Inspection Firewall** ‚Äì Monitors active connections and makes decisions based on connection states.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Proxy Firewall (Layer 5 - Application Gateway)** ‚Äì Acts as an intermediary between users and the internet, filtering requests based on content.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)** ‚Äì Uses advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, and threat intelligence.  


### **Interconnection of ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**
  
ISPs (Internet Service Providers) interconnect to enable global internet communication. This interconnection allows data to travel from one network to another, ensuring seamless internet access for users worldwide.  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of ISP Interconnections**
There are three primary ways ISPs connect to each other:  

### **1.1 Peering (ISP-to-ISP Connection)**
- **Definition:** Direct connection between two ISPs to exchange traffic without a third party.
- **Types:**
  - **Public Peering:** Happens at an **Internet Exchange Point (IXP)**.
  - **Private Peering:** Direct connection between two ISPs using a dedicated link.
- **Example:** Two ISPs (e.g., Airtel and Jio) agree to exchange traffic **without** paying each other.

### **1.2 Transit (Smaller ISP Buying Internet from Larger ISP)**
- **Definition:** A smaller ISP pays a larger ISP (Tier 1) to access the global internet.
- **Example:** A local ISP in a small city buys internet connectivity from a national-level ISP.

### **1.3 Content Delivery Network (CDN) Peering**
- **Definition:** ISPs interconnect with CDNs to cache frequently accessed content closer to users.
- **Example:** Netflix, YouTube, and Cloudflare use CDN peering with ISPs to reduce latency.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ ISP Hierarchy (Tiers of ISPs)**
ISPs are categorized into **three tiers** based on their network reach and interconnection model.

| **Tier** | **Description** | **Example ISPs** |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Largest ISPs with global network reach, forming the backbone of the internet. They do not pay for transit. | AT&T, Tata Communications, CenturyLink |
| **Tier 2** | Regional ISPs that buy internet transit from Tier 1 providers but may also peer with others. | Airtel, Jio, Vodafone |
| **Tier 3** | Local ISPs that buy internet from Tier 2 providers and serve end-users. | Small-town ISPs, broadband providers |

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ How ISPs Connect to the Global Internet**
- **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points):** Locations where multiple ISPs exchange traffic to improve efficiency.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** The routing protocol ISPs use to communicate and exchange routes.
- **Undersea Fiber Optic Cables:** Used for international connectivity between ISPs across continents.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Example of ISP Interconnection**
1. A **local ISP** in a city connects to a **regional Tier 2 ISP** for internet access.
2. The **Tier 2 ISP** connects to a **Tier 1 ISP** for global internet access.
3. Tier 1 ISPs interconnect with each other using **peering agreements** to form the backbone of the internet.

### **Explanation of ISP Interconnection Diagram**  


---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components in the Diagram**  

### **1. Tier 1 ISP (Top Level)**
- These are **global backbone ISPs** that provide internet access to lower-tier ISPs.
- They do **not pay** for transit as they peer with each other.
- Example: AT&T, Tata Communications, CenturyLink.

### **2. Internet Exchange Points (IXP)**
- **IXPs (gray boxes)** serve as **hubs** where ISPs exchange traffic efficiently.
- They help **reduce costs and improve speed** by enabling ISPs to connect directly instead of using intermediaries.

### **3. Regional ISPs (Middle Layer)**
- **Regional ISPs** buy internet transit from **Tier 1 ISPs** and distribute it further.
- They may also peer with **IXPs and Content Providers** for better performance.

### **4. Access ISPs (Bottom Layer)**
- These are **local ISPs** that provide internet to **end-users (homes, businesses, etc.).**
- They rely on **Regional ISPs** for internet connectivity.

### **5. Content Providers (e.g., Google, Netflix)**
- **Content providers** set up direct connections with ISPs and IXPs to serve users faster.
- Example: Google, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook (Meta).

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How Data Flows in the Internet**
1. **User requests a website (e.g., Google.com).**
2. The request travels from the **Access ISP** ‚Üí **Regional ISP** ‚Üí **Tier 1 ISP**.
3. The **Tier 1 ISP** routes the request to **Google's servers**.
4. Google's response follows the same route back, ensuring fast content delivery.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Importance of ISP Interconnections**
‚úÖ **Reduces Internet Costs** ‚Äì Direct peering at **IXPs** avoids expensive transit fees.  
‚úÖ **Improves Latency** ‚Äì Content providers like **Google and Netflix** set up direct connections.  
‚úÖ **Enhances Redundancy** ‚Äì Multiple connections between ISPs prevent network failures.

### **Explanation of the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack Diagram**  

This diagram illustrates a **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack**, a cyberattack that overwhelms a victim's system with excessive traffic, causing service disruption.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components in the Diagram**  

### **1. Attacker (Botmaster)**  
- The main hacker or attacker initiates the attack.
- They **send commands** to compromised systems (slaves/bots) to start the attack.  

### **2. Slave (Botnet) Computers**  
- These are infected computers (also called **zombies**) controlled by the attacker.  
- They send excessive requests or malicious traffic to the victim.  
- Often compromised through malware or security vulnerabilities.  

### **3. Victim (Target Server)**  
- The system under attack (e.g., a website, network, or server).  
- Overwhelmed by traffic from multiple slave computers, causing **slowdown or service failure**.  

### **4. Network Infrastructure**  
- The victim is often connected via a **router, firewall, or load balancer**.  
- The attack may overwhelm these devices, making legitimate access impossible.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How the DDoS Attack Works**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Attacker sends a command** to multiple compromised computers (**slaves/bots**).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Slaves generate a flood of traffic** (requests, data packets, or malicious connections).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The **victim‚Äôs network or server gets overloaded** and becomes slow or completely unavailable.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of DDoS Attacks**  
‚úÖ **Volumetric Attacks** ‚Äì Overloads bandwidth with excessive data traffic.  
‚úÖ **Protocol Attacks** ‚Äì Targets network components (e.g., SYN Flood, Ping of Death).  
‚úÖ **Application Layer Attacks** ‚Äì Overwhelms web applications (e.g., HTTP Flood).  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Defend Against DDoS Attacks**  
üîπ **Use Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).**  
üîπ **Enable Rate Limiting to limit excessive requests.**  
üîπ **Deploy a DDoS Mitigation Service (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).**  
üîπ **Monitor Traffic & Detect Anomalies using AI-based security tools.**

### How DNS Works: From `/etc/hosts` to `resolv.conf` and Top-Level Domains  

DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Here‚Äôs how it works from local configuration files to the global DNS hierarchy:

---

### **1. Local Name Resolution: `/etc/hosts` File**  
- Before querying external DNS servers, a Linux system first checks the `/etc/hosts` file.
- This file contains mappings of domain names to IP addresses.
- Example:
  ```bash
  127.0.0.1   localhost
  192.168.1.10   myserver.local
  ```
- If a domain is found in `/etc/hosts`, the system does not query a DNS server.

---

### **2. DNS Resolver and `resolv.conf`**
- If the requested domain is not found in `/etc/hosts`, the system checks `/etc/resolv.conf` to find which DNS servers to query.
- This file specifies the nameservers (DNS servers) to be used for domain resolution.
- Example:
  ```bash
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 1.1.1.1
  ```
- The system will query these servers in order until one responds.

---

### **3. Querying the DNS Hierarchy**
If the domain is not cached locally, the system queries the configured DNS servers. The process follows a hierarchical structure:

#### **a) Root DNS Servers**
- The request starts at one of the **13 root DNS servers**.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda3d705-c87d-4023-95ed-65f531e8f8d2)

- Root servers direct queries to the relevant **Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers**.

#### **b) Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**
- TLD servers handle domains based on their extensions, such as:
  - `.com` (commercial) ‚Üí `com DNS servers`
  - `.org` (organizations) ‚Üí `org DNS servers`
  - `.edu` (education) ‚Üí `edu DNS servers`
- The TLD server directs the query to the appropriate domain‚Äôs authoritative name server.

#### **c) Authoritative DNS Servers**
- These servers store specific domain records.
- Example:
  - For `amazon.com`, the authoritative DNS server provides the actual IP address.
  - This information is returned to the client.

---

### **4. Caching and Response**
- Once the IP is resolved, the system stores it in a **DNS cache** to speed up future queries.
- Cached results reduce network traffic and response time.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a2246d-7d88-49c4-b798-8f1192e6352b)


---

### **Summary of DNS Resolution Flow**
1. **Check `/etc/hosts`** ‚Üí If found, use the mapped IP.
2. **Check `/etc/resolv.conf`** ‚Üí Identify external DNS servers.
3. **Query Root DNS Servers** ‚Üí Directs to the TLD DNS server.
4. **Query TLD DNS Server** ‚Üí Directs to authoritative DNS.
5. **Query Authoritative DNS Server** ‚Üí Returns the actual IP.
6. **Cache the result** for future use.

### **Understanding Mutual TLS (mTLS) in a Simple Way**  

#### **What is TLS?**  
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is like a **secret conversation** between your web browser and a website.  
- It keeps **hackers from listening** to your data and **ensures the website is real** (not fake).  
- TLS replaced **SSL (an older version)** and is mostly used in **HTTPS websites** (like online banking or shopping).  

---

#### **What is Mutual TLS (mTLS)?**  
- **Regular TLS** only checks if the website is real, but **mTLS** checks **both** sides‚Äîwebsite and user.  
- It‚Äôs like a **double ID check** before entering a secure building.  

#### **Why is mTLS Important?**  
- It‚Äôs used when **both sides need to prove who they are** (like two businesses working together).  
- Example:  
  - In a **Kubernetes** application, different parts (microservices) talk to each other, and mTLS ensures **only trusted services communicate**.  
  - Helps follow **Zero Trust security**, meaning **no one is trusted by default**.  

---

### **How Does mTLS Work?**  
1. **User and server exchange certificates** (like ID cards).  
2. **Both verify each other‚Äôs certificates**.  
3. **Secure communication is established**.  

---

### **Why Use mTLS?**  
‚úÖ **Stronger security** ‚Äì Prevents unauthorized access.  
‚úÖ **Prevents hacking** ‚Äì Ensures only trusted devices/users can connect.  
‚úÖ **Used in APIs & microservices** ‚Äì Protects internal system communications.  

In short, **mTLS is like a VIP security check**‚Äîboth parties prove their identity before talking! üîí

### **Easy Explanation of SSL/TLS Certificate Authentication**  

Whenever you visit a website like **Amazon**, your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) ensures that the website is **legitimate and secure** before exchanging data. This is done using **SSL/TLS certificates** issued by a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.  

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**  

‚úÖ **Step 1: The Web Server Gets a Certificate**  
- Amazon applies for a certificate from a **Certificate Authority (CA)** (a trusted organization that verifies websites).  
- The CA verifies that Amazon **owns the domain** and then issues a **certificate**.  
- Amazon installs this certificate on its **web server**.  

‚úÖ **Step 2: The Browser Verifies the Certificate**  
- When you try to visit Amazon, your **web browser checks the certificate** to ensure it is valid.  
- It verifies the certificate with the CA. If the certificate is **genuine**, the browser proceeds.
