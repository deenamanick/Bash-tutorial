### **Difference Between `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`**  

| Feature              | `/etc/hosts` | `/etc/resolv.conf` |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Maps hostnames to IP addresses locally | Configures DNS servers for domain name resolution |
| **Function**        | Acts as a local DNS for name resolution | Tells the system which DNS servers to use |
| **Usage**           | Used for small-scale manual hostname resolution | Used for large-scale internet domain resolution |
| **Format**         | `<IP Address> <Hostname>` | `nameserver <IP>` |
| **Example Entry**   | `192.168.1.10 myserver.local` | `nameserver 8.8.8.8` |
| **Priority**       | Checked first before querying DNS servers | Used only if the hostname is not found in `/etc/hosts` |
| **Scope**          | Local machine only | System-wide DNS settings |

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `/etc/hosts`**
- A static file for hostname resolution.
- Useful for defining **custom** domain names (e.g., local servers).
- Example:
  ```bash
  127.0.0.1    localhost
  192.168.1.100  myserver.local
  ```
- If you try to access `myserver.local`, your system will use this file to resolve it **before** checking DNS.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `/etc/resolv.conf`**
- Defines the **DNS servers** the system should use for domain name resolution.
- Example:
  ```bash
  nameserver 8.8.8.8  # Google DNS
  nameserver 1.1.1.1  # Cloudflare DNS
  ```
- When you access a website (e.g., `google.com`), your system will query these DNS servers to get the IP address.

---

### **Key Takeaways** üöÄ
- **`/etc/hosts`** is a local, manual method to resolve hostnames.
- **`/etc/resolv.conf`** tells the system which DNS servers to use when resolving **external** domains.
- The system **checks `/etc/hosts` first**, then queries the DNS servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.


## **Difference Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2**  

HTTP/2 is a major improvement over HTTP/1.1, designed to solve its performance bottlenecks. Below is a **detailed comparison** between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

| Feature          | **HTTP/1.1**  | **HTTP/2** üöÄ |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Connection Type** | **Text-based** (ASCII) | **Binary-based** (More efficient) |
| **Multiplexing** | ‚ùå **No multiplexing** (Head-of-Line Blocking) | ‚úÖ **Multiple requests can be sent simultaneously** on a single connection |
| **Request Prioritization** | ‚ùå No built-in prioritization | ‚úÖ **Allows prioritization** of important resources |
| **Header Compression** | ‚ùå No compression (Large headers) | ‚úÖ **HPACK compression** (Reduces overhead) |
| **Data Framing** | ‚ùå **Plaintext format** (Harder to parse) | ‚úÖ **Binary framing** (More efficient) |
| **Server Push** | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **Server Push** (Server can pre-send resources) |
| **Security** | üîí **Optional TLS** | üîí **TLS is required in major implementations** |
| **Performance** | üöÄ **Slower** (More round trips) | üöÄ **Faster** (Reduced latency & better efficiency) |

---

### **üîπ Key Improvements in HTTP/2**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Protocol (More Efficient)**  
   - HTTP/1.1 used **text-based commands** (e.g., GET, POST), while HTTP/2 converts them into **binary format** for better performance.  
   - **Example:** Instead of `GET /index.html`, it uses `0b0001 1010`.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multiplexing (No More Head-of-Line Blocking)**  
   - HTTP/1.1 **processes one request at a time per TCP connection**, leading to delays.  
   - **HTTP/2 allows multiple requests in parallel** over a **single connection**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **HPACK Header Compression**  
   - HTTP/1.1 **sends full headers with every request**, increasing network overhead.  
   - HTTP/2 **compresses headers**, reducing redundant data transfer.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Server Push (Proactive Resource Delivery)**  
   - HTTP/1.1 waits for the client to request each resource.  
   - HTTP/2 allows the **server to "push" resources** (e.g., CSS, JS) **before the client requests them**.  

---

### **üõ† Example: HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2 Request Flow**
#### **üî∏ HTTP/1.1 Request**
1. Browser requests **index.html**.  
2. Server responds with **index.html**.  
3. Browser sees it needs **style.css** ‚Üí Sends a new request.  
4. Server responds with **style.css**.  
5. Browser sees it needs **script.js** ‚Üí Sends a new request.  
6. Server responds with **script.js**.  
‚è≥ **Each request waits for the previous one ‚Üí Slower loading!**  

#### **üîπ HTTP/2 Request**
1. Browser requests **index.html**.  
2. Server **sends index.html, style.css, and script.js simultaneously** (Multiplexing + Server Push).  
3. Browser loads the page much faster! üöÄ

### **Conclusion: Should You Upgrade?**
‚úÖ **Yes! HTTP/2 is significantly faster, more efficient, and secure.**  
‚úÖ **Most modern browsers and web servers support HTTP/2.**  
‚úÖ **Major sites like Google, Facebook, and YouTube already use HTTP/2.**
