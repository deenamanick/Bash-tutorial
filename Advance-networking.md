### **Difference Between `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`**  

| Feature              | `/etc/hosts` | `/etc/resolv.conf` |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Maps hostnames to IP addresses locally | Configures DNS servers for domain name resolution |
| **Function**        | Acts as a local DNS for name resolution | Tells the system which DNS servers to use |
| **Usage**           | Used for small-scale manual hostname resolution | Used for large-scale internet domain resolution |
| **Format**         | `<IP Address> <Hostname>` | `nameserver <IP>` |
| **Example Entry**   | `192.168.1.10 myserver.local` | `nameserver 8.8.8.8` |
| **Priority**       | Checked first before querying DNS servers | Used only if the hostname is not found in `/etc/hosts` |
| **Scope**          | Local machine only | System-wide DNS settings |

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `/etc/hosts`**
- A static file for hostname resolution.
- Useful for defining **custom** domain names (e.g., local servers).
- Example:
  ```bash
  127.0.0.1    localhost
  192.168.1.100  myserver.local
  ```
- If you try to access `myserver.local`, your system will use this file to resolve it **before** checking DNS.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `/etc/resolv.conf`**
- Defines the **DNS servers** the system should use for domain name resolution.
- Example:
  ```bash
  nameserver 8.8.8.8  # Google DNS
  nameserver 1.1.1.1  # Cloudflare DNS
  ```
- When you access a website (e.g., `google.com`), your system will query these DNS servers to get the IP address.

### **Key Takeaways** üöÄ
- **`/etc/hosts`** is a local, manual method to resolve hostnames.
- **`/etc/resolv.conf`** tells the system which DNS servers to use when resolving **external** domains.
- The system **checks `/etc/hosts` first**, then queries the DNS servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
